# Laserpoint-Tracking

Tracks small movements of a laserpoint on images taken with a shaky camera. It detects the laserpoint as well as a reference point in the background using Blob Detection and
calculates the distance between those two points in the x- and y-direction. If these distances change, the laserpoint has moved.
